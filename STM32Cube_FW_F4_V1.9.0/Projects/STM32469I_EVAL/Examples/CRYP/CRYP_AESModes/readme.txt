@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the CRYPTO peripheral to
encrypt and decrypt data using AES in chaining modes (ECB, CBC, CTR) and all key
sizes (128, 192, 256) Algorithm.

For this example, a firmware is used to interface with the Crypto peripheral
in polling mode.

This example behaves as follows:

1. ECB mode:
   - AES128 ECB encryption
   - AES192 ECB encryption
   - AES256 ECB encryption
   - AES128 ECB decryption
   - AES192 ECB decryption
   - AES256 ECB decryption
2. CBC mode:
   - AES128 CBC encryption
   - AES192 CBC encryption
   - AES256 CBC encryption
   - AES128 CBC decryption
   - AES192 CBC decryption
   - AES256 CBC decryption
3. CTR mode:
   - AES128 CTR encryption
   - AES192 CTR encryption
   - AES256 CTR encryption
   - AES128 CTR decryption
   - AES192 CTR decryption
   - AES256 CTR decryption

Firstly, The Plain data, encrypted data and decrypted data can be displayed on a PC
HyperTerminal using the UART.

The USARTx is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled


Or either, the Plain data, encrypted data and decrypted data can be displayed on 
debugger terminal IO by uncomment following line in main file: 
//#define TERMINAL_IO_OUT 
  
@note The connection of the LCD reset pin to a dedicated GPIO PK7 instead of the STM32F469 NRST pin may cause residual display on LCD with applications/examples that do not require display.
	  The LCD clear can be ensured by hardware through the board's power off/power on or by software calling the BSP_LCD_Reset() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F479xx devices.

  - This example has been tested and validated with STM32479I-EVAL revB board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled
    
  @note Make sure that :
    - jumper JP8  is on RS232_RX position (1-2)  and 
    - jumper JP15 is on USART1_RX position 1-2)and 
    - jumper JP19 is on USART1_TX position (1-2). 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
