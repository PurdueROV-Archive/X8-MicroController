@par Example Description 

- Test description:
This example provides a short description of how to use the DAC peripheral to 
do a simple conversion in 8 bits right alignment of 0xFF value, the result of 
conversion can be seen by connecting PA4(DAC channel1) to an oscilloscope.
The observed value is 3.3V.
      

STM32469I-EVAL board's LEDs can be used to monitor the process status:
  - LED3 is ON and example is stopped (using infinite loop)
  when there is an error during process.

@note The connection of the LCD reset pin to a dedicated GPIO PK7 instead of the STM32F469 NRST pin may cause residual display on LCD with applications/examples that do not require display.
	  The LCD clear can be ensured by hardware through the board's power off/power on or by software calling the BSP_LCD_Reset() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  - This example runs on STM32F469xx/STM32F479xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested and validated with STM32469I-EVAL revB board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32469I-EVAL revB Set-up
    
      - Connect PA4 (DAC Channel1) on eval board connector (pin 21 in CN5) to an oscilloscope.
      

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
