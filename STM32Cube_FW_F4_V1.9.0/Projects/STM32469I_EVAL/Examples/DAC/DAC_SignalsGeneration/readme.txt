@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the DAC peripheral to 
generate several signals using DMA controller.
For each press on Tamper push-button, a signal has been selected and can be monitored on  
the DAC channel one:
    - Triangle waveform (Channel 1), amplitude: ~1V, frequency: order of tens Hz.
    - Escalator waveform (Channel 1) using DMA transfer, amplitude: ~3V, frequency: order of KHz.

As PA4 is connected to other device on the eval board (Potentiometer and Camera) the analog output may be corrupted.
In case please remove camera module and/or move RV1 potentiometer 

STM32469I-EVAL board's LEDs can be used to monitor the process status:
  - LED3 is ON and example is stopped (using infinite loop)
  when there is an error during process.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
    
@note The connection of the LCD reset pin to a dedicated GPIO PK7 instead of the STM32F469 NRST pin may cause residual display on LCD with applications/examples that do not require display.
	  The LCD clear can be ensured by hardware through the board's power off/power on or by software calling the BSP_LCD_Reset() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  - This example runs on STM32F469xx/STM32F479xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested and validated with STM32469I-EVAL revB board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32469I-EVAL revB Set-up :
      - Connect PA4 (DAC Channel1) (pin 21 in CN5) to an oscilloscope.
      - Use Tamper push-button connected to PC.13.
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
