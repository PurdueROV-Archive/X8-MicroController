@par Example Description 

This example guides you through the HAL API different configuration steps 
to ensure 32-bit long random numbers generation by RNG peripheral.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 180 MHz.

The RNG peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_RNG_Init() function.
The latter is calling the HAL_RNG_MspInit() function which implements
the configuration of the needed RNG resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
GPIO, DMA and NVIC). You may update this function to change RNG configuration.

After startup, user is asked to press Tamper push-button.
The 8-entry array aRandom32bit[] is filled up by 32-bit long random numbers 
at each key press. 
The Random numbers can be displayed on the debugger in aRandom32bit variable.

In case of error, LED3 is toggling at a frequency of 1Hz.


@note The connection of the LCD reset pin to a dedicated GPIO PK7 instead of the STM32F469 NRST pin may cause residual display on LCD with applications/examples that do not require display.
	  The LCD clear can be ensured by hardware through the board's power off/power on or by software calling the BSP_LCD_Reset() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F469xx/STM32F479xx devices.

  - This example has been tested and validated with STMicroelectronics STM32469I-EVAL revB board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
