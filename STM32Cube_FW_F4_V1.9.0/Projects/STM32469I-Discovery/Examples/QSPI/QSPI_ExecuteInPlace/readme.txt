@par Example Description

This example describes how to execute a part of the code from the QSPI memory. To do this, 
a section is created where the function is stored.

At the startup, the QSPI memory is erased, then the data are copied from the initialization
section of the flash to the QSPI memory. And finally the QSPI is configured in memory-mapped 
mode and the code in executed in a forever loop.

LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 toggle in a forever loop.
LED3 is on as soon as an error is returned by HAL API, and no more LED toggles.

In this example, HCLK is configured at 180 MHz.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The connection of the LCD reset pin to a dedicated GPIO PH7 instead of the STM32F469 NRST pin may cause residual display on LCD with applications/examples that do not require display.
	  The LCD clear can be ensured by hardware through the board's power off/power on or by software calling the BSP_LCD_Reset() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F469xx devices.

    
  - This example has been tested with STM32469I-DISCOVERY board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32469I-DISCOVERY Set-up :
    - Board is configured by default to access QSPI memory

  - A specific region for the QSPI memory has been added in the scatter file 
   (STM32F469xx_flash.icf for IAR toolchain, STM32469I-DISCOVERY.sct for Keil toolchain)
   in order to map functions in this memory

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
